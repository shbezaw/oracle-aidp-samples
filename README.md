# Oracle AI Data Platform Workbench Samples

This repository contains a curated collection of sample notebooks demonstrating how to build data pipelines, run machine learning workloads, and integrate AI capabilities using **Oracle AI Data Platform (AIDP) Workbench** — a unified, governed workspace for data engineering, ML, and AI development powered by Apache Spark.

## What is Oracle AI Data Platform Workbench?

Oracle AI Data Platform Workbench is a unified, governed workspace for building, managing, and deploying AI and data-driven solutions. It brings together notebooks, agent development, orchestration, and catalog management in a single collaborative platform — empowering teams to explore data, fine-tune models, and operationalize AI with trust and speed.
